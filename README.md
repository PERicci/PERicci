### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ | OlÃ¡! ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· | Â¡Hola! ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸

## I'm Pedro Eugenio Ricciardi. Welcome to my profile!

As a tech and science enthusiast, I have always loved knowing how the universe works and how I can help to improve people's lives. This passion led me to choose a career as a science teacher (physics, mathematics and robotics).

After a few years of robotics teaching, I realised that I had great potential to contribute to the tech industry. Confident that the skills and expertise I developed add quite well to the tech career, I decided to migrate to it.

I started my studies in front-end web development with the famous triad: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Nowadays, I am fully engaged in React, keeping Next.js and Typescript on my radar.

Well, feel free to check out my repository. It's still in the beginning, but there's already a lot of affection and dedication involved.
